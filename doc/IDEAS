Some investigating into the following will be required:

*command line parsing: Check out option--, it may or may not work.

*other: yacc/lex-- http://cholm.home.cern.ch/cholm/


Implement something to perform lookup translations, such as gamma, etc.
For example... Something like:
table barf = Tables.get_gamma_table(1.3);
unsigned char foo = barf[10];
Woubld be equivalent, but much faster, than the standard calculation:
unsigned char foo = (unsigned char)(((unsigned char)(-1)) *
				    pow(10 / double((unsigned char)(-1)),
					1.3));
